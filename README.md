This bot is still in development and i will add more commands in the future, if u have any ideas for new commands or how i should improve the bot feel free to let me know :)

- You will also need a https://etherscan.io/ API key which you can also get for free once you sign up

- To find a collection slug, go on https://opensea.io/ and find the collection you would like to use. 
- Once you have found the collection, the slug name of the collection will be in the link like so: https://opensea.io/collection/(collection slug)
